# ImageProcessing
A notebook containing techniques used in image processing such as:

- Channel Splitting
- RGB to Gray Conversion
- Transformations such as flipping, rotation, rescaling & resizing
- Retrieving Histogram
- Filtering
- Masking
- Contrast Enhancement
- Restauration & Enhancement
- Adding & Reducing Noise
- Segmentation
- Contouring
- Edge Detection
- Corner Detection -> (coming soon)
- Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) -> (coming soon)
